# Lossless-Compression-Project
**User Guide**  

1. **Uploading the Files:**  
   Upload the text file and the image file intended for compression to the projectâ€™s code directory.  

2. **Choosing the Compression Algorithm:**  
   The program will prompt the user to select the desired compression algorithm:  
   - To choose **Huffman Coding**, the user should enter **1** and press **Enter**.  
   - To choose **Lempel-Ziv**, the user should enter **2** and press **Enter**.  

3. **Huffman Coding:**  
   a. If the user selects **Huffman Coding** (by entering **1**), the program will ask the user to input a short text sample to demonstrate how the algorithm compresses the text (this works with any language).  
   The following compression details for the text and image files will be displayed:  
   - Average bits per character.  
   - Length of the string.  
   - File size (in bits) after compression.  
   - Time taken to compress the file.  
   - File size (in bits) before compression.  

4. **Lempel-Ziv Compression:**  
   b. If the user selects **Lempel-Ziv** (by entering **2**), the program will display the following compression details for the text and image files:  
   - Length of the string.  
   - Length of the array generated by the Lempel-Ziv algorithm.  
   - File size (in bits) after compression.  
   - Time taken to compress the file.  
   - File size (in bits) before compression.
